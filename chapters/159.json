There is a spidery, handwritten copy of something named The Emerald Tablet. But perhaps most intriguing is a small book of strange poetry bound in black, published in Boston in 1919. The cover reads Azathoth and Others, by Edward Derby. You’ll have to hide the larger volumes, but you can pocket the Derby book." },
